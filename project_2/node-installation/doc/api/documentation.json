          "desc": "<p>Throughout the documentation are indications of a section&#39;s\nstability. The Node.js API is still somewhat changing, and as it\nmatures, certain parts are more reliable than others. Some are so\nproven, and so relied upon, that they are unlikely to ever change at\nall. Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous\nand in the process of being redesigned.</p>\n<p>The stability indices are as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-txt\">Stability: 0 - Deprecated\nThis feature is known to be problematic, and changes may be planned. Do\nnot rely on it. Use of the feature may cause warnings to be emitted.\nBackwards compatibility across major versions should not be expected.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-txt\">Stability: 1 - Experimental\nThis feature is still under active development and subject to non-backwards\ncompatible changes, or even removal, in any future version. Use of the feature\nis not recommended in production environments. Experimental features are not\nsubject to the Node.js Semantic Versioning model.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-txt\">Stability: 2 - Stable\nThe API has proven satisfactory. Compatibility with the npm ecosystem\nis a high priority, and will not be broken unless absolutely necessary.\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note</em>: Caution must be used when making use of <code>Experimental</code> features,\nparticularly within modules that may be used as dependencies (or dependencies\nof dependencies) within a Node.js application. End users may not be aware that\nexperimental features are being used, and therefore may experience unexpected\nfailures or behavior changes when API modifications occur. To help avoid such\nsurprises, <code>Experimental</code> features may require a command-line flag to\nexplicitly enable them, or may cause a process warning to be emitted.\nBy default, such warnings are printed to <a href=\"process.html#process_process_stderr\"><code>stderr</code></a> and may be handled by\nattaching a listener to the <a href=\"process.html#process_event_warning\"><code>process.on(&#39;warning&#39;)</code></a> event.</p>\n"

Node functions which simply wrap a syscall,\nlike <a href=\"fs.html#fs_fs_open_path_flags_mode_callback\"><code>fs.open()</code></a>, will document that. The docs link to the corresponding man\npages (short for manual pages) which describe how the syscalls work.</p>\n<p>Some syscalls, like lchown(2), are BSD-specific. That means, for\nexample, that <a href=\"fs.html#fs_fs_lchown_path_uid_gid_callback\"><code>fs.lchown()</code></a> only works on macOS and other BSD-derived systems,\nand is not available on Linux.</p>\n<p>Most Unix syscalls have Windows equivalents, but behavior may differ on Windows\nrelative to Linux and macOS.
